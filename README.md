 # Some background information on Hurricanes 

 Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with winds that exceed 64 knots (74 mi/hr) and blow counterclockwise about their centers in the Northern hemisphere, (clockwise in the Southern hemisphere).

 Hurricanes are born over the warm waters of the tropical oceans, where humid air and converging winds fuel convective processes responsible for developing hurricanes.

 Hurricane season typically extends from June through November, when water temperatures in these regions are relatively high (greater than 26.5 C or 79.7 F). Most hurricanes occur in late summer and early fall, i.e., August and September. Hurricanes are larger than thunderstorms and tornadoes but smaller than mid-latitude cyclones

# Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale


## Category 1	

74-95 mph
64-82 kt
119-153 km/h	

Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds

Very dangerous winds will produce some damage: Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.

## Category 2

96-110 mph
83-95 kt
154-177 km/h	

Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds

Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks.


## Category 3 (major)

111-129 mph
96-112 kt
178-208 km/h	

Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds

Devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.


## Category 4 (major)

130-156 mph
113-136 kt
209-251 km/h	

Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds

Catastrophic damage will occur: Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.


## Category 5 (major)

157 mph or higher
137 kt or higher
252 km/h or higher	

Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds

Catastrophic damage will occur: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

# About the Hurricane/Typhoon data:

 ### Status column in the dataset can be the following types:
 ### TD – Tropical cyclone of tropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
 ### TS – Tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity (34-63 knots)
 ### HU – Tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity (> 64 knots)
 ### EX – Extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
 ### SD – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
 ### SS – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical storm intensity (> 34 knots)
 ### LO – A low that is neither a tropical cyclone, a subtropical cyclone, nor an extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
 ### WV – Tropical Wave (of any intensity)
 ### DB – Disturbance (of any intensity)
