Comparing Hurricane/Typhoon data from 1851-2015 with global CO2 emissions to evaluate a possible correlation


# About the Hurricane/Typhoon data:

 Status can be the following types:
 TD – Tropical cyclone of tropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
 TS – Tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity (34-63 knots)
 HU – Tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity (> 64 knots)
 EX – Extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
 SD – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
 SS – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical storm intensity (> 34 knots)
 LO – A low that is neither a tropical cyclone, a subtropical cyclone, nor an extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
 WV – Tropical Wave (of any intensity)
 DB – Disturbance (of any intensity)

 # Some background on Hurricanes 

 Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with winds that exceed 64 knots (74 mi/hr) and blow counterclockwise about their centers in the Northern hemisphere, (clockwise in the Southern hemisphere).

 Hurricanes are born over the warm waters of the tropical oceans, where humid air and converging winds fuel convective processes responsible for developing hurricanes.

 Hurricane season typically extends from June through November, when water temperatures in these regions are relatively high (greater than 26.5 C or 79.7 F). Most hurricanes occur in late summer and early fall, i.e., August and September. Hurricanes are larger than thunderstorms and tornadoes but smaller than mid-latitude cyclones
